In SQL, a common error is to forget to handle NULL values appropriately. For example, if you try to perform an arithmetic operation or string concatenation on a column that contains NULL values, the result might be unexpected.  Consider this example: `SELECT col1 + col2 FROM mytable;` If either `col1` or `col2` has a NULL value, the result of the addition will be NULL, not zero as some users expect. Another less obvious scenario is when using aggregate functions like `AVG()` or `SUM()` on columns with NULL values; these functions ignore NULLs by default. This can lead to incorrect averages or sums if you didn't account for the potential presence of NULL values. This is further compounded with implicit type conversions. For example, a string concatenated with a null would result in a null.
