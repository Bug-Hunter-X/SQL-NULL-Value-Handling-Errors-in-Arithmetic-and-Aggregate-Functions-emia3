This repository demonstrates a common SQL error related to handling NULL values in calculations and aggregate functions. The `bug.sql` file shows the erroneous SQL code that produces unexpected results due to the presence of NULL values. The `bugSolution.sql` file demonstrates how to resolve this using the ISNULL or COALESCE functions to correctly manage NULL values within the operations.
